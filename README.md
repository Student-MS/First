Project Analysis
---------

A project as big as this should have its functionality split into three main parts depending on the type of user (which is identified at the time of authentication). These users include:

* Students: Students are designed to be consumers. They login to access their data, download assignments, upload solutions and projects, respond to feedback provided, and so on.
* Professors: Professors are designed to be providers. They login to provide details about students like feedback, update attendance, communicate with the students, upload assignments, and so on.
* Administrator: Administrators are designed to be the hierarchical elements that form the interconnecting bridge between Professors and students. They are the masters of the system â€“ creating and editing account details, managing the mass inflow of information, checking the status of any submissions, and so on.

Some of the features of the student management system project:
 1. Admissions
  The Student Management System software is designed to assist students in managing their admissions processes, from initial contact to course enrollment.
 2. Accountability
  The reporting tool allows the university to monitor patterns in student behaviour and analyse the results to improve their performance.
 3. Monitoring Student Fees
    The university administration department may manage billing dates, impose late fees, create invoices, and get a report of accepted payments automatically throughout the year.
